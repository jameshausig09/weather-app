Hey man, we fixed the issue with the CMS Storyblok issue, I would like you to continue with that, adding information for example about each city of your choice - for example if you create a city called Singapore you could also create a field in Storyblok called "additionalInfo" or "bio" meaning biography, and provide a little bit of text about the city that you then pull into your code and place somewhere, maybe in your Overview? Have a look. Any questions please ask me or Alica. Cheers!
