## My weather app - hey whats up

 <!-- Task for 3. July -->
1. I have added a bug in your Overview.js, somewhere in there the styling and the syntax is not meaningful enough. Can you figure out how to correctly style and name your tags so that they accurately reflect better what you are seeing?
- HINT: Do the tags correctly show what you intend to see? Do the classes accurately reflect the right styles?
2. I have added a bug in your CityCard.js - can you find it?
- HINT: Are all the guards correct?
3. There is a bug in your index.js, can you find it?
- HINT: Are the paths correct?
